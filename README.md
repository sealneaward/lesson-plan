# lesson-plan
Lesson plan to expand the skills of individuals without any coding experience.

### Setup

Depending on your preference, you may want to change your default terminal.
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a good alternative for mac users.

Also, having a good text editor is another great Python learning tool.
I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Another great tool, that is great for first time learners is PyCharm, which is an IDE made by JetBrains. If you have an existing educational email, you can get free access. If you have PyCharm, then you can skip this step.
