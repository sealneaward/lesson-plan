# Arrays and For Loops

Today's lesson will use Jupyter Notebooks. In order to use notebook, you must have the jupyter Python package installed.

1. Open up Terminal and run this install command.

```
pip install jupyter
```

2. Navigate to the lesson-plan repository (using cd).

3. Run the jupyter notebook in the `lessons/arrays-for-loops` directory.

```
jupyter notebook lessons/arrays-for-loops/arrays-and-for-loops.ipynb
```

4. You should now have the notebook open up in Chrome. Let me know if you have questions about running the code.
